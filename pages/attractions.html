    <h4 class="ft-500 text-center bottom-m-20">Akamas Peninsula</h4>
    <p class="text-justify font-md">The Akamas peninsula, next to Azzurro Luxury Holiday Villas, covers about 230 square km and is located on the western tip of Cyprus. It is an area of great natural beauty unaffected by development. The uniqueness of the area for Cyprus, and for the whole of the Mediterranean, is centered on its precious ecology. The diversity of flora and fauna living in this relatively small area is truly impressive. Rare endemic plants grow there and foxes, snakes and other reptiles as well as many types of migratory birds live in Akamas or use it in their movements.</p>
    <p>In addition to its species habitats, the area is also important because of its diverse community habitats. Some of these are: Pine and juniper forests, Maquis forest, Gorges, Sand dunes, Cliffs etc.</p>
    <p>A vitally important characteristic of this peninsula is its beaches. Akamas is the last large unspoiled coastal area remaining in Cyprus and one of the very few important sea turtle nesting areas in the Mediterranean. Both the Loggerhead Turtle (Caretta-caretta) and the rarer Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas) nest here; the latter depends on the Akamas beaches for its very survival in this region. The IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) lists Loggerheads as “vulnerable” and Green Turtles as an “endangered species”. According to the IUCN, the annual number of Green Turtle nesting females in the entire Mediterranean could be as low as 325-375.</p>

    <h4 class="ft-500 text-left bottom-m-20">Avakas Gorge</h4>
    <p>A masterpiece of nature, Avakas Gorge is situated in the unspoilt Akamas peninsula 1 km from Azzurro Luxury Holiday Villas. A trekker’s paradise, it offers spectacular views and a generous introduction to local flora and fauna, including the endangered centauria akamantis – an endemic plant found only in the gorge. Carved out of limestone rocks, rising up as high as 30 metres and narrowing dramatically at one point, the gorge is a fairly difficult hike as the rough track winds its way along and over the stream that formed this natural wonder over thousands of years. Parts of the walk are slippery and involve a certain amount of clambering over rocks and stones. Solid footwear and sensible clothes are recommended. Visitors are advised to take ample drinking water and urged not to enter the gorge alone without first informing someone of their plans.</p>
    <p>Rich in flora, the gorge has pine trees, cypresses, junipers, wild fig trees, ferns and oaks among other trees as well as a profusion of wild flowers. Prize specimen among them is the extremely rare endemic centauria akamandis with its purple flowers that blossoms in the spring. Animal life includes foxes, hares, falcons, crows, night owls, butterflies and a large number of reptiles. The gorge is some 3km long.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 text-left bottom-m-20">Agios Georgios Pegeia</h4>
    <p>Agios Georgios at Pegeia, 1.4km from Azzurro Luxury Holiday Villas, is a famous place of pilgrimage in the Pafos (Paphos) region in the west of Cyprus. Three early Christian Basilicas and a bath, all 6th century, were excavated in the early 1950s. Later excavations revealed an extensive unwalled settlement that occupied the neck and the south slope of the cape in the Roman and early Christian periods. The advantageous position of the settlement suggests that it was probably a port of call for ships transporting grain from Egypt to Constantinople. The settlement flourished under Justinian I (527 – 565 A.D.). The necropolis lies at the brow of the cliff with tombs carved into the rock.</p>
    <p>There is a small chapel founded in the late 13th early 14th century also named after Agios Georgios. The stone – built church of Agios Georgios was built around 100 years ago. Agios Georgios is still today a traditional working fishing village where you can sample the fresh catch in the local fish Taverna.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 text-left bottom-m-20">Coral Bay in Cyprus</h4>
    <p>The popular resort of Coral Bay 4 km from Azzurro Luxury Holiday Villas, provides all the facilities for a perfect holiday in the sun. The resort centre is lined with shops, bars and restaurants offering a choice of both Cypriot and international cuisine. Down on the beach, the shallow waters are wonderful for bathing and water sports. The ancient capital of Paphos is a short drive or bus ride away with an array of historical sites, as well as livelier nightlife. Close by, the charming village of Peyia offers the perfect place to sample Greek Cypriot meze in a traditional taverna.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 text-left bottom-m-20">Lara Beach – some 1.4km from Azzurro Luxury Holiday Villas – is possibly the most naturally beautiful bay in Cyprus</h4>
    <p>This long, shingly stretch of coast is totally free of development, so the only sounds you’ll hear are the crashing of waves and the calling of wild birds. This makes Lara Beach a breath of clean, cool, fresh air. Only Monk Seals and Turtles populate this wilderness which has been preserved specifically for their protection – every year the beach is entirely closed off for the breeding season, so make sure you time it right! If you need relief from the croads, this is best place to find it. Lara Beach offers crystal waters and spectacular, unspoilt scenery. It’s a place to relax and clear your mind, with no one around to disturb you.</p>
    <p>So bring your own mat, a picnic, and definitely a good book! Stay around till late evening for sunset – you won’t forget it. If you’re feeling active, the mountainous terrain that engulfs on all sides is great for long walks and offers exceptional views across the peninsula on which Lara Beach lies. This area is part of the Akamas National Park.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 text-left bottom-m-20">Peyia</h4>
    <p>he village of Peyia, 2.5km from Azzurro Luxury Holiday Villas, lies on the south western tip of the lovely island of Cyprus and is probably one of the most colorful and interesting villages on the island! Whilst the original Peyia village was a small, stone built community of farmers whose crops were mainly bananas and oranges, Peyia has grown in strength to be the Municipality of Peyia, governing the area from Akamas Peninsular in the west to the edges of Paphos on the east side. Paphos is only 15 mins by road from Peyia village and Coral Bay resort is only a few minutes down the road.</p>
    <p>Today, Peyia retains its charms but has grown up to be a very vibrant and welcoming large village, whose population is a mix of many nationalities; the most of whom are Cypriot or UK ex pats! Peyia is developing into a thriving and enjoyable area in which to holiday or simply visit. Many tourists choose to stay in Peyia to enjoy a taste of traditional Cypriot welcome mixed with the many, more modern western ways they’ve become accustomed to. From joining the older Cypriot men enjoying backgammon and coffee in the Kafenes to visiting a very trendy wine bar, the village, Peyia has something for everyone.</p>
    <p>Set on a hillside, the views are magnificent, the people warm and friendly – and the facilities first class! With beaches only 2 km away, its no wonder that Peyia is fast becoming first choice for holidaymakers looking for quality, culture and value for money.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 text-left bottom-m-20">Sacred Island</h4>
    <p>Yeronisos, or “Sacred Island”, is 12,000 square meters of rocks, rising dramatically from the swelling seas just off the coast of western Cyprus. Excavations show that Yeronisos had an active Chalcolithic phase (3100 B.C.) and flourished under the rule of the famous Egyptian Queen Cleopatra (50-30 B.C.). Coins, pottery, glass, inscriptions, and unique architectural remains suggest that Yeronisos preserves one of the most signficant Ptolemaic sites outside of Egypt.</p>

    <p>The mosaic decorations and the mythological compositions are the main characteristics of this restored Roman villa, dating back to the second century A.D. The house is named “House of Dionysos” thanks to the many depictions of Dionysos, the god of wine.

    <p>Pafos castle was originally a Byzantine fort built to protect the harbour. It was rebuilt by the Lusignans in the 13th century, dismantled by the Venetians in 1570 during the Ottoman invasion and rebuilt by the Ottomans after they captured the island in the 16th century. Originally, this role was served by the Saranta Kolones fort, the ruins of which lie a few hundred meters to the north. During its long history, the Pafos Castle was used, as well as for protection, as prison cells, and even as a storage area for salt when the island was a British colony. In 1935 it was declared an ancient monument and today is considered as one of the hallmarks of the Pafos region. Many cultural events take place in the square just in front of the castle, while during September each year the Pafos Aphrodite Festival which presents a different opera every year staged here by world famous artists with the castle building usually acting as part of the scenery.</p>

    <p>The Panagia Chrysopolitissa church was built in the 13th century over the ruins of the largest Early Byzantine basilica on the island. Within the compound one can see St. Paul’s Pillar, where according to tradition Saint Paul was flogged before the Roman Governor Sergius Paulus was converted to Christianity. Originally the church was seven–aisled, but later was reduced to five aisles. The floor of the basilica was covered with colourful mosaics, some of which are still preserved.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 text-left bottom-m-20">Christian Basilicas at Pegeia</h4>
    <p>In the town of Pafos, as well as in the rest of Cyprus, many fine Christian basilicas were constructed during the Early Byzantine period. Today in Pafos, the remains of two such basilicas are preserved, that of Panagia Chrysopolitissa and Panayia Limeniotissa. The basilica of Panagia Chrysopolitissa is situated in the eastern part of the town. It is the largest basilica excavated so far in Cyprus and once it was the cathedral of the town and the seat of its bishop. It was built at the end of the 4th century and destroyed in the middle of the 7th century, during the Arab raids. This was originally the seven-aisled basilica, which was rebuilt and modified several times. The Medieval church of Agia Kyriaki stands nearby.</p>
    <p>The basilica of Panagia Limeniotissa is situated a short distance from Pafos harbour. This is a three-aisled basilica, built at the beginning of the 5th century. Very few sections of its mosaic floors with geometric patterns have been preserved. Three other basilicas, one next to the other, have been excavated in the Cape Drepano area, about 15 kilometers northwest of Pafos. They are known as the basilicas of Agios Georghios tis Pegeias. The largest of them, a three-aisled basilica, was built in the middle of the sixth century, the second one a few years later and the third at the end of the 6th or the beginning of the 7th century.</p>
